# Troubleshooting

## CI Fails After Initial Push

**Cause**: Required services not configured.

**Solution**: Complete all sections in [docs/foundry/getting-started.md](getting-started.md).

## Missing Secret Errors

**Cause**: Repository secrets not configured.

**Solution**: Add required secrets at https://github.com/aignostics/foundry-python-core/settings/secrets/actions:
- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
- `SONAR_TOKEN`

## Tests Not Running in CI

**Cause**: Tests missing category marker.

**Solution**: Add `@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`, or `@pytest.mark.e2e` to each test.

## Pre-commit Hook Failures

**Cause**: Code doesn't meet quality standards.

**Solution**: Many hooks auto-fix issues. Re-stage files and commit:
```shell
git add <fixed-files>
git commit
```

## Coverage Dropping

**Cause**: New code not covered by tests.

**Solution**: Add tests for new code, or verify new tests have category markers.

## Commit Message Rejected

**Cause**: Message doesn't follow conventional commit format.

**Solution**: Use format `type(scope): description`. Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`.



## Renovate PR Causes Test Failures

**Cause**: A dependency update introduced a breaking change.

**Solution**:
1. Check which package was updated in the Renovate PR description
2. Review the package changelog for breaking changes
3. Fix the compatibility issue in a commit on the Renovate branch (Renovate branches accept external commits)
4. If the fix is complex, close the Renovate PR and pin the dependency version in `pyproject.toml` until you can address it
